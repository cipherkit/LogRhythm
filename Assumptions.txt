Assumptions

   1. That input can be a malformed attempt at JSON and should trigger an error.
   2. That Create, Retrieve, Update and Destroy operations should be implemented to some extent.
   3. That Retrieval is of the Output format contracted. (I left dictionary curly brackets in the interest of time.)
   4. That Update is not implemented because we don't lose the input file and can modify it running the program again.
   5. That the input file should use a input system that is encapsulated. (File input feature left out in the interest of time.)
